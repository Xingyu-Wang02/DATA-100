# Reflection 2: Data Science-the new epistemology


**“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.”
Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014)**

In “Big Data, New Epistemologies, and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen, the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. 


In the first article, “Big Data, New Epistemologies, and Paradigm Shifts,” the writer first described the present Big Data’s characteristic and then presented the measurement revolution. The comparison between Big Data and the traditional census method highlights one of the most essential features of Big Data; the production of data used in Data Science is continuous. “Big Data is characterized by being generated continuously, seeking to be exhaustive and fine-grained in scope, and flexible and scalable in its production,” as mentioned in the article. Kitchen admitted and reviewed the Data Science’s development and the measurement’s resolution in his report. However, at the end of the passage, he also addressed some challenges and drawbacks of the current Data Science. He pointed out that “The situation in the humanities and social sciences is somewhat more complex given the diversity of their philosophical underpinnings, with Big Data and new analytics being unlikely to lead to the establishment of new disciplinary paradigms.”  In other words, Data Science is undoubtedly a powerful tool for data analysis but will not completely replace the traditional “small data studies.”

In the second article, “The End of Theory,” the writer admits that “only models, from cosmological equations to theories of human behavior, seemed to be able to, if imperfectly, explain the world around us consistently.” Big Data approaches are the most efficient way to handle complex things. For instance, he suggests Big Data can solve Google translation works without knowing the sentences’ meanings. Then, he presents more examples of data’s application in various science fields. In the past, we used logic to generate a model which will then explain certain phenomena. Simultaneously, with the help of Data Science, it provides people with more opportunities to come up with a model before understanding the mechanism. As the passage mentioned, “the new availability of huge amounts of data, along with the statistical tools to crunch these numbers, offers a whole new way of understanding the world”.

**—How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study?** 

“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.” Big Data is denoted by its high volume, high speed, and wide applications. “Data” is the premise of Data Science. Data used in Big Data analysis is generated from different channels; for instance, the advent of mobile phone, email, help to generate and propel the Data Science’s development. As presented in the first article, “Wal-Mart was generating more than 2.5 petabytes (250 bytes) of data relating to more than 1 million customer transactions every hour.” The huge volume of information to be processed drives the development of Data Science. Sequentially, the development in Data Science allows simulation of complex phenomena and data mining, advance our revolution in measurement. The emergence of new Data Science technology helps to build up a new “scientific method” in sciences. As a result, it creates a new epistemology which helps to combine the sciences together. With the only element “data” are people able to apply data science to various of fields. 

**—How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships?**

People generate patterns from the large amount of data they gathered. Data deluge offers possibilities and potentials to shift “from data-scarce to data-rich studies of societies; from static snapshots to dynamic unfolding; from coarse aggregations to high resolutions; from relatively simple models to more complex, sophisticated simulations’” Also, we are able to, with abundant amount of data, verify our results in different settings and situations.

However, the conclusion from it can sometimes only be a source of prediction but not an explanation; the fundamental logic lies behind data is “inductive” but not “deductive.” Therefore, people focus on the “majority”, where they can get the most data, instead of the equally important “minority.” Which means, our understanding of human behavior, through data science, is not comprehensive to a great extent.

**—How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?**

With its sophisticated and well designed algorithms, data science offers ways to examine the data in a new way, based on empiricism. It provides “the counter problem of handling and analyzing enormous, dynamic, and varied datasets by collecting data and extracting patterns.” Data scientists are able to continue to explore new methods of data science and innovate the application of data on the basis of previous empirical methods.

However, data analysis, although for different data, is based on similar logic and epistemology. Besides, “causation” does not indicate “correlation”. Therefore, it is sometime inappropriate to throw a massive amount of data into computer and get an easy result. The statistical relationship or outcome is the quickest way to handle a complex system but not necessarily the most effective way to it.

Data Science provides us a brand new method of understanding our world. It gives us the outcome without explaining the mechanism in between. Admittedly, it improves and speeds up our understanding to unknowns; however, we may also ignore the correlations and logics between things because of these new epistemologies. What if all sciences come together and become a single science——Data Science?
