# Reflection 4-Geoff West: scale
**Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.

Geoff West proposes the question that whether we could represent the complex activities with universal rules. In fact, in the reading, the author provides many examples of how similar patterns have been found in seemly unrelated events or systems. In these examples, “scale” is used to give a more comprehensive or fresh view towards human development. For instance, Geoff states the famous ¾ metabolic rate. Which means, with one unit (pound) bigger, the animal only needs ¾ more energy to maintain its metabolic activity. Therefore, even though an elephant is much larger than an ant, the system responds as a sublinear model when an organism’s, the elephant in this case, size changes. 

1). Companies
Surprisingly, companies behave similar to organisms and seems to obey the ¾ rule. In other words, with the company’s size increases, it needs less energy or cost to produce one more unit of output, which is called “the economy of scale” in economics. Birth-Growth-Death cycle also happens among the millions of companies all around the world. Growth doesn’t occur without the supply of energy. A company’s scaling process is quite similar to that of an organism. First, every single factor within a company goes into the growth state. For instance, the number of employees, the firm’s estate, the firm’s profit, etc. As the company grew steadily, its growth begins to slow. Things gradually goes into repair, maintenance, etc. Referring to the scaling of organisms and the ¾ metabolic rate, the energy required to sustain life increases faster than the supply of metabolic energy, forcing a systematic decline in the amount of energy available for growth, ultimately to zero. It is this mismatch between the scale of maintenance and the scale of supply that ultimately leads to the cessation of growth.

2). Cities
The book presents how we could scale a city’s growth. Worth noticing, a city, comparing to a company, is a more complicated entity. However, instead of the ¾ exponents that govern organisms, the exponents 0.85 and 1.15 play a critical role in urban systems. In addition, a city is not centrally controlled, meaning that every individual is working on their own intention within the city, the entity. We could think it as an ant colony where each ant has their own task to perform, which together form a not simple system. It indicates that a city is more than its buildings and people. Therefore, we cannot simply use a linear model when thinking of its mechanism. In fact, the urban system across the globe follows the “15 percent rule” on a per capita basis. By doubling the size of a city, we could get an approximately 15 percent per capita increase in wages, wealth, and innovations. However, it also means that the city will receives 15 percent more crime, pollution, and other negative externalities. For the individual, he or she will get more job opportunities as well as higher risk of getting virus or violent. Furthermore, West recognizes that scaling laws, when comes to cities, are useful between that within the same national urban system. For instance, we may not be able to compare the overall scale of Japanese city directly to that of an American city.

3). Connections
Thirdly, we could also scale our interactions with others and the social connections as a whole. He gives the famous “six degrees of separation” as an example. It means that, on average, “the number of links connecting any two people is approximately just six.” This scaling shows how closely people around the world are connected and correlated. Moreover, it proves how modular structure could be used to characterize “small-world networks,” and how them satisfy power law scaling.  

According to Geoff West, we need a “big theory” to go with the “big data.” It is certainly highly impossible to generate a perfect model for all different. Instead, we might never provide detailed predictions of complex systems such cities, but coarse-grained descriptions, a general theory, or a general way of thinking, that lead to quantitative predictions are plausible. He quotes from the famous physics, Stephen Hawking, that “the next century will be the century of complexity;” and our next mission is to think of a theory behind the trend and complex data. Nevertheless, West claims that the scaling theory we need is different Newtonian paradigm, which only has a small number of equations to buttress “everything” in physics. Instead, scaling theory provides a powerful tool for us to study the complex systems more effectively and more efficiently. For instance, we could even measure the walking speed and compare it with the city development. Data and the theory complement each other. We need to propose conjectures and predictions to promote the data generations and utilization. In other word, without the appropriate guidance from theories, people can possibly misunderstand or misuse data. West presents the fact that we are generating tons of data everyday all around the world: about 2.5 exabytes. However, more astonishingly, the LHC program, particle collision program, generates about 150 exabytes a day if 600 million collisions occur each second. Obviously, without the underlying physics theories, it is impossible to use machine-learning on its own to analyze the huge amount of data. Therefore, it is crucial for us to develop a theory for big data and understand every piece of data we are utilizing. By doing so, can data science be a much more powerful tool to make the world a better place.
