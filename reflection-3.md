# Third Reflection_Development and Complexity, slide and audio lecture by Owen Barder, CGD

*Q1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?*

Owen Border defines development as “a property of the economic and social system itself.” Amartya Sen’s definition bases more on individual achievements, while Owen Border say Development is not individual success but property of the system as a whole.

*Q2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?*

The toaster project is about making a complete toaster from draft. Basically, Thomas Thwaites attempted to construct a toaster from zero by buying all the raw materials he needed. Then, he brought them together. For instance, the video mentioned about how he tried to smelt irons with a trash bin and a leaf blower (as a replacement to the bellow). Thomas called it “successful” but the toaster only worked for about 5 seconds and it exploded. This example shows that even building a simple and cheap thing needs a lot of inputs. Therefore, the economy growth is not only about improvements individual firms, but that of a system.

*Q3 According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?*

The economic models do not provide comprehensive views most of the time since the system is more complex than we think. Those models are based on the sum of what happens to individuals and firms. For example, the growth model and the virtuous circle failed to consider the influences of technology. Also, other models may bear no resemblance to reality at all. (e.g. Rober Solow’s neoclassical theory, although mentioned about exogenous technological change aspect, did not explain where the technology comes from) Hence, over the past 50 years, the conventional economic models do not do great on describing the economy growth. Also, for the development difference between Ghana and South Korea, these models fail to provide a persuasive and perfect explanation. 

*Q4. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results? *

Steve Jones is now a famous evolutionary biologist. He started his career in a soap factory. Generally, he designed a better nozzle by testing different kinds of designs and choosing the “best” one among them. His success brings a tremendous improvement in soap making efficiency and teaches us that, when dealing with a complicated system, it is critical to go through failures and test different approaches. It is more efficient and effective than understanding the underlying logic and develop a universal theory (since it is really hard to have a perfect model, and the models may become outdated in the future)

*Q5. What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?*

A complex adaptive system means a system that contains a lot of interactions between a very large number of adaptive agents, which are co-evolving. Here are some of its important features:
Difficult or impossible to predict in details (e.g. butterfly effect)
We can make broad-brush predictions about the system as a whole
Emergent properties (e.g. thunder storm)
They tend towards greater complexity	
They do not tend towards an equilibrium

*Q6. Who was Haile Sellasie? According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?*

Haile Sellasie is the emperor of Ethiopia around 1930 (the last feudal dynasty of Ethiopia). He rules his country in a strict and irrational way. Under his supreme power, the rest of the country and his servants hide the negative truth from him. The book The Emperor gives a compelling account of internal logic of the regimes, extracting economic value from their population and by “suppressing any effort” to move to a more inclusive and political society which might “threaten their position.” Haile Sellasie’s absolute rule suppressed the systemic change.

*Q7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?*

 Barder proposed that Adaptation is suppressed by elites. By Resist engineering (can not predict) but harness them. “Avoid isomorphic mimicry” basically means that one model/solution does not fit all. Therefore, by mimicking the strategies which work for rich countries does necessarily solve the solution for the poor countries. In other words, Barder suggests that it is not the best choice for developing countries to adopt the developed countries’/international best practice. In this case, isomorphic mimicry means that taking the so called “best practice” and pretending to function well from the outside but not the inside. ( “institutions which adopt the camouflage of capable organization”)

*Q8. What does Barder mean by “resist fatalism”? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution*

Barder means, by “resist fatalism” that we should not accept fate/outcome as it is. Instead, we should actively improve the current situation and bring out new solutions and attempts from time to time. Norman Borlaug is a fantastic man who save billion of lives from starvation by inventing a new way to breed the crops. Correspondingly, the green revolution is a set of  innovations/new technologies that improve the crop bred and the worldwide agriculture production.
