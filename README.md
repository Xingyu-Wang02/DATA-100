# Hello World! I'm Xingyu Wang from BEIJING, CHINAðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
I am interested in Economics, Statistics, and pure math theories. Besides, I am a piano and flute player. I also love playing sports, especially running and playing badminton. My friends taught me to play basketball during my first semester at W&M, and it soon became one of my favorite sports! I have a lovely British shorthair named "Blueberry" and a shiba named "Pie." (Yes! I got the idea of my dog's name from the math symbol "Ï€")
