-How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of urban areas?
As the graph presented, the major residential area is located at flat ground. 

-How has topography appeared to have impacted the development of transportation facilities?
Similarly, the transportation facilities are mostly built at flatter parts. However, there are roads that built across hills and help to connect areas that are separated by hills.

-How has topography appeared to have impacted the location of health care facilities?
Since the health care facilities are built around the residential areas, they are also built at flatter grounds. However, we can see from the graph that there are only two clinics marked on the areas I’ve chosen. This is not usual since the areas have a population about 200, 000 in total. Therefore, I zoom out the graph and plot all the health facilities in Congo. It turns out that most of the health facilities are allocated around two major areas: Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville. These are the largest and the second largest city of Congo. In other word, there are 293 recorded health facilities in Congo and most of them are from the financial centers or capital city of Congo. There are two possibilities. 1). The technology development and society development differentiate significantly between major cities and peripheral cities. 2). We are lack of these peripheral cities’ data and information（whihc is one of the problems that has been addressed by the article we have read, "Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development"）. 

-Has producing your three-dimensional map resulted in an interpretion that is different from your previous analysis?
A three-dimensional map definitely improves my analysis to some extent. Obviously, it provides a more intuitive sense of the topography. As a result, we can better compare and conclude the relationship between topography and other factors.
